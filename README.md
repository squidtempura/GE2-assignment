# Storyboard
The story is about the war between two planets. One of the planets is called Astra, and the other is called Traiwynd. Both planets are poor in resources and need to be sourced from other planets. And the space fleets of these two planets often clash over resources as they explore the universe.
The scene takes place when the space fleet of Astra returns from the exploration of the planet encountering with space fleet of Traiwynd. The space ships pursue the mothership at beginning. When enemies appear, they move and fire towards the enemies to cover the evacuation of the mothership.
